## Getting Started

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12.0 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/palani22/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application. The page will reload when you make changes, and you may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back! If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
